# Unreal Engine Compute Shader Destroy - Comunity Version


This is a branch of the repository related to the Compute Shader Tutorial series https://youtu.be/19q6eXw2pI0
To make this more game ready some improvements are need to be made.

## TODO
 - Calculating collision spheres by Compute Shader, and saving collision per model/preset (so it will not be calculated on start)
 - Enabling collision interaction on distance (so it will not be calculated when the player is far away)
 - Simple Granades (using destroy by hit point)

If you have any suggestions or want to add 3d assets go ahead.
